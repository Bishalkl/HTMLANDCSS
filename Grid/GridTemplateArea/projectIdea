Project: Responsive Dashboard Layout with CSS Grid Template Areas

Create a responsive dashboard layout with Grid Template Areas. This project can be a great way to practice this feature and create a visually appealing dashboard.

Requirements:

Create a container with display: grid and define a grid template with named areas for the dashboard sections, such as header, sidebar, main content, and footer.

Place and style the following items within the defined areas:

Header: Add a navigation menu, logo, and user profile section.
Sidebar: Create a navigation menu with links to different sections of your dashboard.
Main Content: Display various widgets, charts, or data tables.
Footer: Include copyright information and links.
Use media queries to make your layout responsive. For instance, on smaller screens, you can change the layout or hide the sidebar.

Apply styling and design to make your dashboard visually appealing.

Test your dashboard on different screen sizes to ensure it's responsive and the grid areas adapt to different viewport sizes.

By working on this project, you'll gain practical experience in using Grid Template Areas and create a functional and aesthetically pleasing dashboard layout. You can also customize this project according to your interests and expand its features as you become more comfortable with CSS Grid and Grid Template Areas.
